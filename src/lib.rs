//! Repackage `.crate` files under a different crate name.
//!
//! This crate provides [`repackage::dot_crate`](dot_crate), which repackages a `.crate` file so
//! that it exports the same crate under a different name. It replaces the `name` attribute in
//! `Cargo.toml`, and also rewrites references to the old name in the various `.rs` files that live
//! outside of `src/` (those in `src/` use `crate::`).
//!
//! # Rewriting .rs files
//!
//! Normally, rewriting the `name` in `Cargo.toml` should be sufficient for _most_ use-cases.
//! Consumers of a `.crate` file likely only care about the exported library, which only ever
//! refers to itself using paths starting with `crate::` or `::`, not including the name. Tests and
//! binaries do have to name the library crate, but are usually not used by downstream consumers of
//! the `.crate`. But, _just_ in case, this crate tries to modify those files as well using some
//! simple string replacement. It's brittle though, so you might only get so far with that approach
//! if you make heavy use of non-library artifacts in the produced `.crate` files.
